              <p>Sun</p>
            </div>
            <p class="txt-contents">The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as visible light and infrared radiation. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth.</p>

              <p>Moon</p>
            </div>
            <p class="txt-contents">The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. At about one-quarter the diameter of Earth,it is the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, and the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System overall. Orbiting Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km or about 30 times Earth's diameter, its gravitational influence slightly lengthens Earth's day and is the main driver of Earth's tides.</p>

              <p>Earth</p>
            </div>
            <p class="txt-contents">Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. About 29.2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 70.8% is covered with water, mostly by oceans, seas, gulfs, and other salt-water bodies, but also by lakes, rivers, and other fresh water, which together constitute the hydrosphere. This is where we are now.</p>

              <p>Mars</p>
            </div>
            <p class="txt-contents">Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, with surface features reminiscent of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts and polar ice caps of Earth.</p>
